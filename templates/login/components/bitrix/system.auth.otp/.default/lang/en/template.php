To make your Bitrix24 data more secure, your administrator has enabled extra security option: a two-step authentication.<br/><br/>
Two-step authentication involves two subsequent stages of verification. The first one requires your main password. The second stage includes a one-time code sent to your mobile phone (or using a hardware dongle).<br/><br/>
<div class=\"login-text-img\"><img src=\"#PATH#/images/en/img1.png\"></div>
<br/>
Once you have enabled two-step authentication, you will have to pass two authentication screens:<br/><br/>
- enter your e-mail and password;<br/>
- then, enter a one-time code that can be obtained using the Bitrix OTP mobile app you have installed when enabling two-step authentication.<br/><br/>
Run the app on your mobile phone:<br/><br/>
<div class=\"login-text-img\"><img src=\"#PATH#/images/en/img2.png\"></div>
<br/>
Enter the code you see on the screen:<br/><br/>
<div class=\"login-text-img\"><img src=\"#PATH#/images/en/img3.png\"></div>
<br/>
If you use multiple Bitrix24's, make sure the code is for a correct Bitrix24 before entering it.<br/><br/>
<div class=\"login-text-img\"><img src=\"#PATH#/images/en/img4.png\"></div>
<br/>
In case you never had a chance to enable and configure two-step authentication or lost your phone, please contact your administrator to restore access to your Bitrix24.<br/><br/>
If you are the administrator, please contact <a href=\"http://www.bitrix24.com/support/helpdesk/\">Bitrix Helpdesk</a> to restore access.";
