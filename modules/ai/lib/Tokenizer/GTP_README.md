# GPT-3-Encoder-Decoder-PHP
PHP BPE Text Encoder/Decoder for GPT-2 / GPT-3

## About
GPT-2 and GPT-3 use byte pair encoding to turn text into a series of integers to feed into the model. This is a PHP implementation of OpenAI's original python encoder and decoder which can be found [here](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2). The main source of inspiration for writing this encoder was the NodeJS version of this encoder, found [here](https://github.com/latitudegames/GPT-3-Encoder).

You can test the results, by comparing the output generated by this script, with the [official tokenizer page from OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/tokenizer).

This specific encoder and decoder is used in the [Aiomatic WordPress plugin](https://1.envato.market/aiomatic), to count the number of tokens a string will use when sent to OpenAI API. Check more of my work on my [website](https://coderevolution.ro/).


## Usage

The mbstring PHP extension is needed for this tool to work correctly (in case non-ASCII characters are present in the tokenized text): [details here on how to install mbstring](https://www.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.installation.php)


```php

$prompt = "Many words map to one token, but some don't: indivisible. Unicode characters like emojis may be split into many tokens containing the underlying bytes: ü§öüèæ Sequences of characters commonly found next to each other may be grouped together: 1234567890";

$token_array = gpt_encode($prompt);

$original_text = gpt_decode($token_array);

```
