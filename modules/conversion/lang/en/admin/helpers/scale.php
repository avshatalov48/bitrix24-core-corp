action, to all visitors.
<br><br>
For example last month your website has gained 10000 unique visitors a hundred
of which has completed an order. The conversion rate is 1%. Your rival's website
has attracted the same 10000 visitors two hundred of which has completed an
order - the conversion rate here is 2% meaning their website is more profitable.
<br><br>
This ratio here is only applicable to web stores, the conversion rate of other
projects may be dramatically better.";
