<p><b>Customer relationship management (CRM)</b> is a strategy for managing a company's interactions with customers, clients and sales prospects. It involves using technology to organize, automate, and synchronize business processes - principally sales activities, but also those for marketing and customer service. CRM stores client relationship information for further analysis.</p>
 
<p>Bitrix CRM is built upon the following concepts.</p>
 
<ul> 
  <li><b>Contact</b> is a record containing data of a person with whom your company will have or already has a relationship.</li>
 
  <li><b>Company</b> is a record containing information about an organization with which your company has or may have a relationship. </li>
 
  <li><b>Lead</b> is a record containing data of a prospective contact for whom some information (email, phone), is available but with whom no formal interaction has yet occurred.  </li>
 
  <li><b>Event</b> is any change in contacts, leads or companies. For example: adding a new phone number. 
 </li>
 
  <li><b>Deal</b> is a record of a financial transaction with a Client or Company.  </li>
 </ul>
 
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
 
<p>Depending on your business requirements, the <b>CRM</b> can be used:</p>
 
<ol> 
  <li>as a contact and company database;</li>
 
  <li>as a classic <b>CRM</b> system.</li>
 </ol>
 
<h4>1. Using the CRM as a Database</h4>
 
<p>The CRM system can act as foundation for tracking business relationships. In this case, the main entities are the Contacts and Companies and the Events which relate to them, combining to form a complete description of the relationship&#65533;s history.  In this regime, it is still possible to create Leads and Events that apply to them so that they can be converted into Deals.</p>

<h4>2. Classic CRM System</h4>
 
<p>If you wish to utilized the CRM as a true customer relationship management system, the starting point would be creating a Lead which can be added manually or imported from Bitrix Site Manager.  Once created, the lead may be processed and eventually converted to a contact, a company or a deal. If a converted lead remains a contact or a company, it becomes a database record either of the Contact or Company type. If the Lead becomes a Deal, then its passage through the sales funnel is indicated accordingly. </p>
