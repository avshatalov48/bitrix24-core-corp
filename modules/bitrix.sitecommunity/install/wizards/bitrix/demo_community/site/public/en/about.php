<p>The Cycling Club is a social network of people who enjoy riding their "two-wheeled friends". The Club's site is a platform for exchange of information, experience, and planning. You can write your own comments in blogs and discuss activities and events in forums.</p>

<p>Bicyclists are not all the same. Some enjoy leisurely riding in the evening on bikes designed for comfort, others like mountain-biking on real mountains. In our Club, each member can find information about his particular interests.</p>
