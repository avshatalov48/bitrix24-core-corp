Effectively, this means that each user is now granted permission to view public information, and given a password to access their private area.

Configurable access to the portal areas provides us with teamwork features: we can now edit documents; create workgroups; elaborate on reports - together!

The purpose of the portal is to make the communication chain between users as short as possible. The portal, being the fast and modern means of communication, is the best method to avoid paper work and transform the business information flow into an electronic course.
 
Using the intranet portal, the organization users can obtain any technical, reference or juridical information including the corporate standards and identity.

The users can post to forums; send requests to technical support and supply services; share and exchange documents; discuss organization news and get the latest information from the management.

The portal will become the essential part of our organization!";

Looking to protect against possible threats, we have enabled an extra security feature for Bitrix24: two-step authentication.

Two-step authentication is a special method to protect against hacker software, particularly password theft. Every time you log into the system, you will have to pass two levels of verification. First, you will enter your e-mail and password, then you will enter a one-time security code obtained from your mobile device.

This will make our business data secure even if the login and password of any user are stolen by an attacker.

You have 5 days to enable this feature.

To configure the new authentication procedure, please go to your profile and select the \"Security Settings\" page.

If you don't have a suitable mobile device to run the application, or if you experience any kind of problem, please let us know by commenting on this post.";
