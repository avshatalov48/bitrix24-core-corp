 A special characteristic of the Global Food sales concept is that the product range of each store is tailored to the requirements of the local target group. The goods on our shelves and refrigeration units are carefully selected according to the consumer behavior and demands of the respective region. Approximately 90 percent of the merchandise on our stores is purchased from local producers and suppliers within the respective country.
