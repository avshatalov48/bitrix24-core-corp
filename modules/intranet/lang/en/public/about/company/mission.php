<br /><br />
The goal of our corporate strategy is to increase the value of Global Food over the long term.
<br />

<br />
Today, we already generate almost 50 percent of our total sales abroad. Our international expansion activities focus on the growth markets of Eastern Europe and Asia. Accelerated expansion and international development of our sales network form the cornerstone of our profitable growth. Here, we place emphasis on success, not size. This means that return is more important to us than simple volume growth.
<br />

<br />
Our goal is to offer investors an optimal return on investment. We will further develop our corporate portfolio on a long-term basis using a value-orientated approach. To continuously increase the value of our sales brands, we focus our business activities and capital allocation exclusively on sustainable and profitable market segments.
<br />

<br />
The standardized Group-wide compliance program introduced in 2008 combines and complements existing measures to ensure compliance with these rules. The goal of the compliance program is to support all Global Food employees in observing the relevant laws, regulations and codes of conduct.
