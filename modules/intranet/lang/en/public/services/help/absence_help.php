</li>

<li>Use the <b>Add attendees</b> link to pick people you wish to invite to the meeting.</li>
 </ul>
Use the scheduler to find the best place and time to gather. It will help you check if the selected persons are available at the proposed meeting time, and notify you if some of them cannot participate in the meeting: the period of time during which an employee is unavailable is highlighted.

<br />

What if you are so busy that you won?t be able to attend the meeting? Make other people aware of such a misfortune, it?s just that simple: create an event in your calendar for this period of time describing your busy or away status. The event will be visible in the public <b>Absence Chart</b>. If you already have this kind of event whose timing intersects with the time of the meeting, just select <b>Away (Add to Absence Chart)</b> in the <b>User's availability</b> field, which will ultimately produce the same result.
<br />
<br />
  <b>Example:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>open your personal calendar;</li>

          <li>create a new event and select <b>Away</b> in the <b>User's availability</b> field;
<p><img height='387' border='0' width='532' src='#SITE#images/en/docs/new_personal_absence.png' /></p>
</li>

          <li>save changes.</li>
         </ul>



<p>Now, you can see the <b>Absence Chart</b> showing your away status (in the <b>Month</b> tab).</p>
