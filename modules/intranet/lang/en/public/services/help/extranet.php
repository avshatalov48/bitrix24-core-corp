<p>The <b>Extranet </b>module is an extension to Intranet Portal enabling a
company to establish confidential communication with contractors, suppliers,
distributors or other external users while prohibiting third parties to access
private corporate information.
</p>
<p><b>Extranet</b> is a secure information space to interact with external
environment. The collective web space is specially designed for effective
co-operation with partners. Invite your partners and colleagues to extranet
workgroups and work over your collective, shared tasks and problems. This
solution ensures that your communication is secure while preserving the Intranet
security. </p>

<h3>Access And Security</h3>

<p>The invited users who are not the company's employees gain limited access
permission and, what is essential, permission to view the Extranet pages only.
These users are not allowed to view company's private information. At the same
time, the company's employees can be invited and join the Extranet workgroups to
work with their colleagues and partners together: discuss essential problems in
forums and blogs; work with shared documents; plan activities in calendars;
assign tasks and watch their progress; publish reports and many more.</p>

<h3>Teamwork</h3>

<p>So what are the advantages of Extranet being neutral waters for meetings and
collaboration? Fundamentally and technologically, the solution utilizes the same
principles on which Intranet Portal is based. Extranet teamworking is absolutely
analogous to that in the Intranet Portal workgroups. The only difference is
stricter security policy.</p>

<h3>How To Install?</h3>

<p>When installing Bitrix24, you get the Extranet module installed automatically. However, this might not be the case when upgrading an older version. If the Extranet module is not present on the existing modules list, you have to <a href='/bitrix/admin/module_admin.php' >install it</a> before you proceed.</p>

  <br />
  <i>Installing the Extranet module</i> </div>

<p>After you have successfully installed the module, you will be prompted to run <a href='/bitrix/admin/wizard_install.php?lang=en&amp;wizardName=bitrix:extranet&amp;<?=bitrix_sessid_get()?>' >Extranet Site Wizard</a>
in which you will configure the extranet website parameters.</p>

<p>As soon as the wizard is complete, an <b>Extranet</b> item will show up in
the top menu. The system is up and running and you're good to go!</p>
