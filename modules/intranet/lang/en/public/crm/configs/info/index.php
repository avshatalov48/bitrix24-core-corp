<p><b>Customer relationship management</b> (<b>CRM</b>) is a system aimed at
increasing sales, optimizing marketing efforts and improving customer service. CRM
keeps customer data and relationship history for further analysis.</p>
<p>With CRM, a manager attends a potential client both traveling from a Lead to
successful Deal. </p>
<p>It is common to use the following terms when dealing with CRM.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Contact</b>: a records containing data on a person with whom the
      company managers had any kind of business communication. </li>
	<li><b>Company</b>: a record with data on a company that has (or had) any
      form of business relation with your company. </li>
	<li><b>Lead</b>: information on any kind of communication activity (phone
      talk, e-mails, meeting etc.) that has potential to become a successful
      deal. </li>
	<li><b>Event</b>: describes any change made to a contact, a lead or a
      company. For example, adding a new e-mail address. </li>
	<li><b>Deal</b>: a record containing data about activities undertaken toward
      a customer and aimed to complete a desired business transaction (e.g. a
      sale). </li>
</ul>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>CRM can be used:</p>
<ol>
	<li>as a contact and company <b>database</b>,</li>

	<li>as classic <b>CRM</b>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>1. CRM as a Database</h4>
<p> CRM can be used a database to store contact and company data and keep a
history of relationships. Here, the main entities are a Contact and a Company in
which the relationships are defined by creating Events. Notice that even if you
use your CRM only as a database, it is still possible to derive a Lead as a
result of an Event, and finally convert that Lead to a Deal.</p>

<h4>2. Classic CRM</h4>
<p>In a classic CRM system, the originating entity is a lead that can be added
manually by a manager, or from Bitrix Site Manager or other source. Once added,
the lead can be converted to a contact or a company that are represented by a
common database entry. However, if a lead passes all the stages of a sales
funnel, it then becomes a deal.</p>
