Impressions: 
- The frame is quite low, sometimes my legs get a little stuck when I pedal hard.
- I'm not used to having so many gears!
Likes:
- It's softer than my old one (which I haven't sold yet).
- The front light is quite bright, but it buzzing and I'm told that the generator will sap some speed.
- The pump is a little better than the old one, and it sits just below the seat in a safe an unobtrusive place.
- The lowest speed made me want to try some steep hills, but the only one near me is cobblestone and a full of potholes.
Shortcomings: 
- Switching between the 3 main speeds is a little clunky.
- Alex noticed a slight flaw in the rear wheel (I can't see it).
Overall. Good for riding in the city and well-paved placed. I'll take it to work tomorrow. I really like the look of it and it is a big step up from my previous one.";
