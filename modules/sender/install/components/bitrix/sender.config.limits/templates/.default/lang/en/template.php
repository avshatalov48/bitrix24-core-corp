<br>
The limit is increased every day if you don't send spam. 
<br>
<br>
Initially you can send 1000 messages per day.
<br>
If the number of complaints for your newsletter does not reach the threshold value within 24 hours,
<br>  
the limit will be increased twice for the next day.
<br>  
Thus you can send messages to thousands of recipients just by following the rules and not sending spam.
<br>  
<br>
If the number of complaints for your newsletter exceeds the threshold value,<br>
your limit of 1000 messages will be re-established. Effectively, you will have to wait for several days <br>until you reach the previous daily sending rate.
