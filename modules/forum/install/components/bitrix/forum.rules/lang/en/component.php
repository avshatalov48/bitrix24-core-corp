<div class=\"forum-bold\">General points in closing</div>
<ol>
<li>Do not use avatars that include political or religious matters. Administration reserves the right to delete them after notifying the member via PM.</li>
<li>Do not create threads of political or religious nature. Administration reserves the right to delete these threads without prior notice.</li>

<li>Do not bring the thread up repeatedly if your question is not answered. Otherwise, such actions may be considered importunate and flooding.</li>
</ol>

<div class=\"forum-bold\">General recommendations</div>
<ol>
<li>Use search. Read FAQ. It is likely that your problem has already been discussed earlier. This will save you and other members time.</li>
<li>Be grammatically correct. Spell check your messages before posting them.</li>
<li>Avoid excess quoting. This embarrasses reading and congests a thread.</li>
<li>Please refrain from posting private correspondence in public areas. This will be considered off topic. Use PM instead.</li>
<li>Do not copy contents of verbose web pages to your posts. Instead, use links.</li>
<li>Do not post meaningless messages just to say something.</li>
</ol>

<div class=\"forum-bold\">Administration and moderation</div>
<ol>
<li>Administrators and moderators reserve the right to edit, move, close or delete threads and posts that do not comply with the forum regulations.</li>
<li>Administrators and moderators have the privileged right to interpret the forum rules in the event that forum members report about ambiguity in any of the clause of the forum rules.</li>
<li>Members have the right to appeal against moderator actions taken against them. Any appeal should only be lodged with the site administrators and must be made using private message (PM).</li>
<li>In all cases, the decision of the administration is final.</li>
</ol>";
