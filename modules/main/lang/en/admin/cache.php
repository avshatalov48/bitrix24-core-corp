<li>HTML cache processes only pages listed in the inclusion mask and not listed in exclusion mask;</li>
<li>For non-authorized visitors, the system check for the page copy is stored in the HTML cache. If the page is found in the cache, it is displayed with no system modules included. Statistics will not track visitors. Advertising, Kernel and other modules will not be included as well;</li>
<li>Pages will be sent compressed if the Compression module is installed at the time of cache generation;</li>
<li>If there is no cache found for the page, it is processed in the usual way. After finishing the page load, a copy of the page will be saved in HTML cache;</li>

<p>Cache cleanup:</p>
<ul style=\"font-size:100%\">
<li>If saving data causes exceeding of the disk quota, the cache is completely dumped;</li>

<li>The disk quota should be specified to avoid DOS-attacks on disk space;</li>
