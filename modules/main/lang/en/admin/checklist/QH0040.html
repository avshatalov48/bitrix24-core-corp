<p>When using a multitier configuration (frontend-backend, balancer) you have to
ensure that a correct client IP address is passed on to the web project, which
can be achieved by setting an appropriate HTTP header field (X-Real-IP, X-Forwarded-For)
on a balancer or caching proxy server and then having a web server (in mod_rpaf
etc.) or web application to get this value.   </p> 


<ul>
  <li>Open "Settings > Tools > PHP Settings" and check the value of _SERVER["REMOTE_ADDR"].
    It must be set to your IP address. You can also view this value in "Settings
    > Proactive protection > Control Panel Protection".</li>
</ul>
