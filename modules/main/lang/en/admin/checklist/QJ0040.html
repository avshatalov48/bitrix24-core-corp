<p>It is customary for web developer's clients to come up with genius ideas just
after the release of their websites. This is normal because once a website is
exposed to a real world, many missing features or errors are revealed.
Obviously, implementation of the new functionality or error debugging must be
performed separately without affecting the current version.</p>

<p>All these problems are usually covered by the technical support service of
the Partner who was carrying out the web project design and implementation. A
client may also transfer the project to another Partner, which implies that the
new Partner receives a full set of existing website specification and
documentation. </p> 

<p>On the other hand, errors that may arise in the Bitrix Framework system core
are fixed automatically by obtaining updates via the SiteUpdate system (available
for owners of a valid license key). A client may have a Partner update the
Bitrix Framework platform as a part of the technical support service agreement.
The Partner's custom modules, if any, may be obtaned using Marketplace ("Settings
&gt; Marketplace &gt; Solution Update").</p>

<p>Verify that the file <b>/bitrix/php_interface/this_site_support.php</b> contains 
contact information of a Partner who provides technical support for this web project.</p>
