<p>If your web project requires that a user needs to be able to configure a set
of parameters all at once, use the wizard technology. To get an idea of what a
Bitrix Framework wizard may look like, open the "Settings &gt; System
Settings &gt; Wizards" form.</p>

<p>For example, your web project may need such a wizard to:</p>

<ul>
<li>create a new location/city and add corresponding entries to the e-Store
  dictionaries;</li>
<li>create a complex discount for a certain user group;</li> 
<li>create a user and add him or her to predefined user groups, register the new
  user in certain information blocks and dictionaries (to make the website
  administrator's life easier). </li> 
 </ul> 


<ul>
  <li>Check that, if required by the web project logic, the "Settings &gt;
    System Settings &gt; Wizards" form contains automation wizards for
    Control Panel and/or the public section.</li>
</ul>
