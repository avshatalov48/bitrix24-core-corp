<p>The components 2.0 you create for your projects should be made easy to use
and configure without having to call third-party specialists or the original
developers. Consider an example: thirty components 2.0 were created for use in a
project internally titled as "myproject". Among these thirty components, there
is one titled "Registered Users" dubbed in the namespace as "myproject:members.list".
What parameters a component like this may possibly have? It is a question of the
nature of the project and possible use. Normally, such components have the
following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of users per page;</li>
<li>User name format: short or full;</li>
<li>Maximum number of words in description (the remainder of which is replaced
  with ellipsis when printed on the screen);</li>
<li>Scramble e-mail address (for antispam purposes);</li>
<li>Sort list by: (followed by a combobox with the available columns);</li>
<li>other possibly useful parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is most possible that a project administrator will need to edit these
settings to fit the component to the project requirements.</p>
<p>However, consider the following parameters. They are more than confusing and
generally well understood only by the component developers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data caching algorithm;</li>
<li>JSON request format;</li>
<li>User groups allowed to view lists;</li>
<li>other possibly useful but very obscure parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel these parameters will be of use in the future, isolate them into
a special control group and provide a good documentation, including possible
values, for each of the parameters.</p>
<p>If you create a &quot;standard&quot;, multipurpose component which will be
reused in many projects, make every (reasonably) possible parameter configurable
and describe each of them in the help section. If you don't intend a component
for future use, there is no need to go to such lengths.</p>
<p>Examine the parameters of each of the custom component 2.0 in the public
section. Make sure each of the parameters has a clear, unambiguous name and is
properly described. A project administrator must have a good understanding of
the purpose, possible values and data types of each of the parameters. It is
recommended to verify that each of the parameters intended for administrative
use works as intended.</p>
