<p>When implementing cache support in custom components, the following rules
should be observed by a developer.</p>

<ol>
<li>In cached mode, a component must not perform database API calls or request
  data from database in any other way. Unfortunately, a developer may
  unwillingly make coding mistakes which allow database API calls to bleed
  through even in cached mode.</li>
<li>When a component cannot find cached data for requested parameters, it has to
  create such data and put it to the cache. When creating new data, the
  component's database API calls must be painstakingly optimized. Sometimes
  coding errors may cause excessive database load performing enormous amount of
  SQL queries. </li> 
</ol>

<p>It is recommended that you carefully analyze all database queries a component
performs and optimize the code by using filters, proper sort modes and reducing the
number of properties to fetch. </p>

<p>To analyze the SQL queries, the EXPLAIN command will come in handy for you.
Make sure your SQL selections use database indexes. This can be of great
importance for Components 2.0 because they can create indexes for columns of the
information block element properties table.</p>

<p>This approach should also be applied to database API calls in the service and
initialization scripts. Even if an optimized component is robust, fast and uses
caching, it may interact with an initialization script that executes an outburst
of numerous SQL queries which will kill all your optimization efforts.</p>

<p>To streamline your database optimization work, create and use an <i>optimization
status table</i>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Column 1: Web page address.</li>
<li>Column 2: SQL query count, cache disabled.</li> 
<li>Column 3: SQL query count, cache enabled.</li> 
<li>Column 4: SQL queries optimized. <i>(using the approach described above)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>Check all the website pages and fill the table with performance data. Your
aim is to get the numbers in (3) as small as possible (zero SQL queries is the
ideal value; the Web Analytics module, if used, may produce some surplus which
is normal); the number of SQL queries in (2) must be reduced to a bare minimum.
Once you have optimized a page, make a note in column (4). </p>

<p>You can use this table for your custom components if you like.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create and populate an optimization status table. If time presses, measure
  performance of the most visited pages only. Minimize database load by
  optimizing and adding cache functionality to unacceptably aggressive
  components.</li>
<li>Ensure that all the service and initialization scripts are also optimized
  and that they use only the Bitrix Framework API calls to execute database
  queries. Direct database queries are not allowed.</li> 
</ol>
