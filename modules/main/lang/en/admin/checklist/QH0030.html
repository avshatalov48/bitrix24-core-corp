<p>Bitrix Framework has a range of automated tests to check the software
environment. All tests must pass for Bitrix Framework to work correctly. </p>

<p>Open "Settings &gt; Tools &gt; Site checker":</p>

<ol>
<li>The "Access check" tab: the full check test must pass. Move read-only files
  and folders beyond the web project location.</li> 
<li>The "Configuration check" tab: all the test results must be green. Should
  you see any negative result, contact Bitrix support.</li> 
 </ol>

<p>If you encounter any errors while performing this test, such errors must be
eliminated before you launch the project.</p>
