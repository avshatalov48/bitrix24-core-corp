<p>Even if your web project was designed and developed following the rules and
guidelines, there is always a risk of emergence of slow web pages and components
due to coding errors, unforeseen execution scenarios, mutually incompatible
server software and so on.</p>

<p>To prevent system breakdowns, increase performance reserve and verify system
robustness, always run stress tests. </p>

<p>To get as close to real-life results as possible, import to your website data
of such size that would match the real-life value. For example, if you expect
2.000.000 user profiles, 100.000 products in 10.000 sections and 1.000.000 posts
in the forum surviving 500.000 daily hits - import data of this extent. It is
obvious that the test should be run on the same hardware as will be used in real
life, or at least close to it.</p>


<ol>
<li>Ensure the website is populated with test data of real-life size; the
  testing hardware is the same as will be used in real life.</li>
<li>Open "Settings > Performance > Performance Panel", select 10 minutes
  duration and click "Test Performance". Use longer intervals for better
  precision.
<ol>
<li>Impose some load on the website. This can be any testing software like JMeter, WAPT,
  or just employees or other developers clicking links, adding products to the
  shopping cart etc - it does not matter; what matters is that the degree and
  nature of the load should be the same as in real life.</li>
<li>While the test is at full tilt, browse the website manually and make a
  visual estimation of the following characteristics:
<ul>
<li>the web pages are opening fast;</li>
<li>the images are loaded with the blink of an eye.</li> 
To all intents and purposes, browsing a website that is being stress-tested we
see it through the eyes of a real-life visitor. 
 </ul>
</li>  
 </ol>

</li> 
<li>Once the test is complete, click the "Development" tab and analyze the
  results:
<ul>
<li>View the "20 most heavy pages".</li>
<li>The values in the "Avg. Time" column showing the page generation time
  should not exceed 0.5 sec.</li> 
<li>The "Development errors" column must not show any issues. Any development
  error must be fixed.</li> 
 </ul>
</li>
 </ol>
