<p>If a web project contains a set of custom components that retain a certain
degree of interconnectedness, it is worthwhile to merge them into a single
composite component. This will make the component and data management easier as
well as further development and support.</p>

<p>Check that individual components that may instantiate only in a certain
context are merged in a composite component.</p>

<p>For example, the following imaginary Components 2.0:</p>

<ul>
<li>User's videos;</li>
<li>Video details;</li> 
<li>Upload video;</li> 
<li>Moderate videos.</li>
 </ul>

<p>and other components devoted to video management should be grouped in a
composite component "Videos".</p>
