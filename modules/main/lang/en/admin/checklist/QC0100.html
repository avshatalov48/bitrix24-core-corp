<p>According to the "Model-View-Controller" methodology, custom
component templates must not generate anything except for the HTML layout code.</p>


<p>A <i>Controller</i> is the subject for implementation by the component core.
The controller's main task is to process the input parameters, call the model
methods, process information and pass it over to the view.</p>

<p>A <i>Model</i> is the Bitrix Framework API classes, methods and functions.
The controllers call the model to store, retrieve and search data.</p>

<p>A <i>View</i> is the component template. It renders information to a viewer
(a website visitor) by creating a valid HTML layout.</p>

<p>A component template should passively receive information from the
controller; it must not call the model or use any other active resources. The
component template code should be clear and understandable for an HTML designer,
not only for the developer who creates it. </p>

<p>The presence of any logic that pertains to the controller or model will
result in unreasonably complex component architecture, and may incur development
errors and increase maintenance cost. </p>


<ul>
  <li>Check that all of the custom component templates has understandable logic
    and clear code and does not do anything except for the creation of HTML
    layout.</li>
</ul>
