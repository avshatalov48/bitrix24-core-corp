<p>The Bitrix Framework standard components are fitted, if required, to the
website specifications by duplicating and modifying the component template
and/or creating new templates from scratch. The component kernel is never
modified and thus can be updated using the SiteUpdate technology.</p>



<ol>
<li>View the component template name in the public section. The template must have a clear, comprehensive and distinctive name.

<li>Sometimes a web project requires that a component could be used on different
  web pages with different component templates, for example three different
  sitemap templates with increasing level of detail. Verify that each of the
  templates works correctly on any page of the website, not only on a page to
  which it belongs.</li>
