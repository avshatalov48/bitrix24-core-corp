<p>To manage the web page or section title, description, keywords and breadcrumb
title, a Bitrix Framework powered website uses special properties. Furthermore,
the properties may be used to define additional parameters that control custom
behavior, for example, visibility of an information block data depending on the
current section of a website. It is essential that you describe such parameters
in the website specifications.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure the web page and section properties have sensible and descriptive
    names. You can do it here: "Settings &gt; System Settings &gt; Module Settings
    &gt; Site Explorer", click the "Settings" tab, scroll to
    "Website Definitions" section.</li>
</ul>
