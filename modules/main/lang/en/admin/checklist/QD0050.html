<p>Modern websites use breadcrumb, a popular navigation element allowing
visitors to keep track of their locations.</p>
 
<p>Generally, the website content mirrors the web server structure in which
folders and files are the breadcrumb sections and items. Therefore, a page
existing in a certain web server folder has predefined position in breadcrumbs.
The website content tree may include virtual dynamic sections and items whose
URL is comprised of the file system path portion (e.g. the path to a PHP script)
and virtual portion (e.g. information block parameters).</p>
<p>It is recommended that you use the standard component
"bitrix:breadcrumb" for navigation in your website. </p>
 
<ol>
<li>Create sections of several hierarchy levels and add web pages to them. The
  breadcrumb component should create a correct and valid URL for each of the
  breadcrumb item.</li>
<li>Create sections and elements in any information block whose structure is set
  to be reflected in the website structure: for example, use a catalog
  information block. The breadcrumb component should create a correct and valid
  URL for each information block element.</li> 
<li>Ensure that no developer assistance is required to edit the breadcrumb item
  titles.</li> 
<li>Ensure the breadcrumb items are enabled or disabled correctly depending on
  the availability of the target object.</li>
