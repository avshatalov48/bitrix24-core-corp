<p>Sometimes the standard Control Panel's features are not enough to implement
all the functions required by the web project specification, and the developers
have to develop custom administrative interfaces. In such a case, it is
recommended that you use the quick administrative interface development
technology to reduce development time and risks. The technology provides the
following functionality.</p>

<ul>
<li>Data filtering by any criteria.</li>
<li>Data sorting.</li> 
<li>User-defined report table columns.</li> 
<li>Perform group operations on selected objects: activate objects; change
  object sort order and properties etc.</li> 
<li>Group settings in tabs.</li> 
<li> AJAX, JSON, XML technologies.</li> 
 </ul>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure that the custom administrative user interface uses the Bitrix Framework
    control panel technology to provide compatibility and decrease maintenance
    cost.</li>
</ul>
