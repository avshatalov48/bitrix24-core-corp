<p>To make a web project secure, transparent and high-performance, use only the Bitrix
Framework platform database API's. This is of particular importance for cluster editions.</p>

<p>The platform database API's may be crucial to protect the database from
errors a developer may commit. Such errors can cause information leakage and,
which is dramatically more dangerous, hacker attacks. The Bitrix Framework tools
can help visualize and analyze each database request a page makes when it is
being generated. A properly optimized web project which uses cache technology
(and doen't use the Web Analytics module) should not perform a single database
request.</p>


<p>To check the code added when integrating the design into the system, you need
to perform audit of all the new or altered code of the components, templates and
auxiliary files. This check will be automated in future releases.</p>
