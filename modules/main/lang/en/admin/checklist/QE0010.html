<p>Most web projects, especially large and dynamic ones, have the need to run scheduled
tasks such as periodic calculation of user points, deletion or aggregation of
outdated data etc. To set up periodic tasks, use the Agents form: "Desktop
&gt; Settings &gt; Tools &gt; Agents".</p>

<p>If your web project requires task scheduling, register such tasks as agents
and properly describe them in the project specifications.</p>
   

<ol>
<li>Check that the agents, if required, are configured in "Settings &gt;
  Tools &gt; Agents" and described in the specifications.</li>
<li>Check that the default system agents exist in "Settings &gt; Tools &gt;
  Agents"; correct the time interval if required.</li> 
<li>Check that lengthy tasks (the ones whose execution time is several minutes
  or more) use cron instead of agents (if applicable). Such tasks should also be
  described in the specifications.</li> 
</ol>
