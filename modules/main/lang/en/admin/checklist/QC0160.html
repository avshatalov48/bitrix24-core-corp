<p>To streamline the web page editing in the visual editor, and facilitate
component maintenance and further development, your components and work areas
should return a complete HTML block, all tags closed.</p>

<p>For example, the component should return a whole table with opening and
closing table tags rather than print only individual rows or cells. Similarly,
the component should not print just list items; instead, it should include
proper opening and closing tags ("OL"/ "UL"). </p>
 
<ul>
  <li>Verify that each of the component templates returns a complete HTML block.</li>
</ul>
