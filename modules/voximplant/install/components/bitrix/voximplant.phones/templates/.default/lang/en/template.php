<p>Bitrix24 assigns a server address, login and password to each user. Use them
to configure your SIP phone.</p>
<p>Once you have saved the preferences, your phone is ready for use with Bitrix24.</p>
<p>To connect a phone, open the #LINK_USERS_START#Telephony Users#LINK_END#
page, pick a user and enable telephony for them.<p>
#IMAGE_CONNECT#
<p>As an alternative to SIP phones, you can use a common landline DECT phone connected to
a SIP gateway that converts the signal to SIP format.</p>
<p>A mobile phone is another option for those always on the go. Use your Windows Phone,
iOS or Android based mobile by installing any softphone application on it.</p>
<p>Please refer to the #LINK_COURSE_1_START#training course#LINK_END# for list
of verified devices and connection instructions.</p>
<h3>Using Your Telephony</h3>
<p><b>Making a call from Bitrix24 CRM</b></p>
<p>Don't waste your precious time pushing buttons. Just click Call in CRM and,
hearing your phone chiming, pick it up. The phone will momentarily start dialing
the callee. With your computer still showing the call window, you can always see
the client profile or view the detailed information.</p>
<p>You can always do it old school if you want: dial the number on the phone and
see the computer screen showing the call window, as if you initiated the call
from CRM.</p>
<p><b>Receiving a call</b></p>
<p>An incoming call reaches your browser (or the desktop application) and the
phone simultaneously. You can answer on either device; the conversation will be
recorded irrespective of the way you answered.</p>
<p>When you are conversing via the phone, all the call control buttons (Hold,
Mute, call forwarding) are available in the messenger (or desktop app) window.</p>
<p>Notice that if your desktop phone is connected, all the outgoing calls are to
be made through it. You can disconnect your phone while you are away to make
calls from your browser or desktop application.</p>
