<p>Two methods exist to prevent redirect phishing:</p>
<ul style=\"font-size:100%\">
<li>detect malicious redirects by screening for the lack of the referring page in the HTTP header.</li>
<li>sign links with a digital signature and verify it upon redirect attempt.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following can be used as protection:
<ul style=\"font-size:100%\">
<li>Show redirection warning to a visitor.</li>
<li>Unconditionally redirect a visitor to a site known to be safe.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Recommended for high security level</i></p>";
