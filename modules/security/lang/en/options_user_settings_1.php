$MESS["SEC_OTP_DESCRIPTION_ABOUT"] = "One-Time Password (OTP) was developed as part of the OATH initiative.<br>
OTP is based on HMAC and SHA-1/SHA-256/SHA-512. At present, the two algorithms are supported to generate codes:
<ul><li>counter based(HMAC-Based One-time Password, HOTP) as described in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226\" target=\"_blank\">RFC4226</a></li>
<li>time based (Time-based One-time Password, TOTP) as described in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238\" target=\"_blank\">RFC6238</a></li></ul>
To calculate the OTP value the algorithm takes two input parameters: a secret key (initial value) and a current counter value (the number of required cycles of generation or a current time depending on the algorithm). The initial value is saved in the device as well as on the website once a device has been initialized. If using HOTP, the device counter is incremented on every OTP generation, while the server counter is changed on every successful OTP authentication. If using TOTP, no counter is saved in the device, and the server keeps track of the possible time change of the device on every successful OTP authentication.<br>
Each of the OTP devices in a batch includes an encrypted file containing the initial values (secret keys) for each device in the batch, the file is bound to the device serial number that can be found on the device.<br>
If the device and server counters grow out of sync, they can be easily synchronized back by bringing the server value to that of the device. To do so, the administrator (or a user with appropriate permission) has to generate two consecutive OTP's and enter them on the website.<br>
