<br/>
Bitrix24 tracks all tasks assigned in order to measure how many of them were completed on time and without objections.<br/>
<br/>
The Efficiency indicator offers you a number of benefits. First, it helps you understand individual and group performance. Second, anything that gets measured is easier to improve. Finally, you can base your KPI on this indicator and make intelligent decisions about who gets promoted and rewarded.<br/>
