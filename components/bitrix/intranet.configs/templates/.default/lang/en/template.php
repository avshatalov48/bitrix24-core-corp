Looking to protect against possible threats, we have enabled an extra security feature for Bitrix24: two-step authentication.

Two-step authentication is a special method to protect against hacker software, particularly password theft. Every time you log into the system, you will have to pass two levels of verification. First, you will enter your e-mail and password, then you will enter a one-time security code obtained from your mobile device.

This will make our business data secure even if the login and password of any employee are stolen by an attacker.

You have 5 days to enable this feature.

To configure the new authentication procedure, please go to your profile and select the \"Security Settings\" page.

If you don't have a suitable mobile device to run the application, or if you experience any kind of problem, please let us know by commenting on this post.";
