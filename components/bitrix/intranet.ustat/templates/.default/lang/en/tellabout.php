Social networks have crowded out other communication forms because of their convenience and the simplicity of exchanges messages and media across computers and mobile devices. So let's use the same techniques in our workplace.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=338]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/socnet1.png[/IMG]

[B]Why do we need an internal social network?[/B]

[LIST]
[*]first, we need to consolidate our data, documents, knowledge, and contacts in a single system;
[*]this will simplify and speed up regular operations (it's a lot faster to have a large group weigh in on a topic using a discussion thread rather than a mass email);
[*]you will no longer miss important messages;
[*]you can offer ideas, share opinions, publish useful information - your messages will be seen by everyone (or by those only those you put in the [I]To:[/I] field);
[*]and lastly, you can 'like' posts and boost morale :)
[/LIST]

I suggest starting by getting to know the functionality of our social intranet right now.  I'll tell you how to do that.

[VIDEO WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fN6BsyjOOtY[/VIDEO]

[B]How to send a message[/B]

In our intranet you can share any information relevant to work. Messages can be sent to all employees, an individual group, or to a single user. Recipients will see your message in their general [I]Activity Stream[/I].

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=313]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/socnet2.png[/IMG]

You can attach files, images, add links, tags, and even videos to your messages, and you can mention individual colleagues:

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=330]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/socnet3.png[/IMG]

[B]How to create or enter a group[/B]

Workgroups are a handy tool for projects. To create your own group and invite members to it, use the 'Add' button (the green button in the upper left corner). To join an existing group you can open it from the [I]Workgroups[/I] menu section and click the option to join inside the group (as applicable, some groups are private). 

[B]Showing appreciation[/B]

Do not forget draw attention to the achievements of your colleagues, employees, and even executives: click 'More' in the message menu and select 'Appreciation', the select who you want to honor publicly and select the appropriate icon under the text of the message.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=350]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/socnet4.png[/IMG]

[B]Evaluate Bitrix24 as an internal tool[/B]

Also, you can check how well your team has learned to utilize the various tools inside Bitrix24 - just use the Company Pulse feature and look at the activity.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=271]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/socnet5.png[/IMG]

The Company Pulse helps you keep track of how well the social network is integrated into daily operation. Each employee has a score that can be compared with other colleagues, his or her department, or the whole company.

Check out the posts, comments, photos and files and 'like' some of them. 

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=341]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/likes1.png[/IMG]

[B]How to show that you like something[/B]

If a post or message from a colleague is in the Activity Stream, you can 'like' it using the like button in that post. Likes only take a second but they let the person writing it know that the contribution was valuable to someone and it lets others know that it might be useful to them.

[B]Who likes what[/B]

You can see a list of the users who have 'liked' a post or comment by hovering on the star next to the word like. These likes are important because the search feature will give priority to well-liked content that is relevant to any given search. 

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=255]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/likes2.png[/IMG]

[B]Why is there a rating system with likes?[/B]

Social search - meaning search results that are influenced by likes, help users find documents and discussions that have been particularly useful. 

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=426]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/likes3.png[/IMG]

Messages with the most 'likes' get displayed in the 'Popular Posts' section on the front page.  

[B]What else can you like?[/B]

Messages and comments aren't the only things that can be likes. You can like tasks when they are completed to motivate coworkers to keep working hard. Files and photos can also be liked.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=322]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/likes4.png[/IMG]

[B]Evaluating your liking activity[/B]

To view the how actively you are using the 'like' function, use the Company Pulse and compare your score with that of your department or the whole company. 

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=271]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/likes5.png[/IMG]

[B]Start liking it![/B]

You can start using the 'like' button now in this very post. Don't forget to put likes on files and tasks that you think are important or that you have used as reference. Encourage your colleagues and work a little more as a team - the like button makes it simple!

How can you keep from forgetting all the tasks and get them all done?

Today I invite you to try a new tool - Tasks in Bitrix24. This tool provides a quick and easy way to organize tasks for yourself or colleagues. Remember, most importantly - that Bitrix24 will send reminders about the tasks to make sure they get done on time. 

[VIDEO WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyDI_eZzRb4[/VIDEO]

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=330]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/task1.png[/IMG]

If anyone is still unfamiliar with Tasks, here's how they work: 

[B]How can I create a task for myself or someone else?[/B]

To create a task, click Add > Tasks and in the window that appears put a description of the task, assign it to a responsible person, and set a deadline. If necessary, select additional participants and add files. Save the changes. If applicable, put the task in a workgroup so that a project team can view it.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=359]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/task2.png[/IMG]

[B]How to collaborate using tasks[/B]

Discuss solutions and task details with your colleagues - just add a comment to a task and it will be added to the Activity Stream - and others can reaction instantly to it. It is much easier and faster than a discussion by e-mail or a time-consuming meeting. Also, the whole history of the task will always be at your fingertips: comments and files are stored in the task.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=398]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/task3.png[/IMG]

[B]How to keep task deadlines[/B]

To make sure that deadlines aren't missed, Bitrix24 includes a counter that tells you what requires your most immediate attention. It is available in the 'My Tasks' and in the 'Tasks' tab in your personal profile.   

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=340]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/task4.png[/IMG]

The counter shows incomplete tasks: overdue tasks, tasks that have not yet been looked at, and those which do not have a set deadline. Try to keep the counter number as low as possible - set reasonable deadlines, move them if necessary, and close all tasks when they are completed. The more you put into systematizing your tasks, the more meaningful the number in the counter will be, and if it's zero - you'll know that you are doing really well :)

[B]How to keep track of time spent on tasks[/B]

Monitoring time spent on tasks is easy - just add the task to your daily plan and when you start working on it, move the task status appropriately. You can also add time spent in the task form itself.

When you choose the 'track time spent' option when you are creating a task, the duration of the task will be tracked.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=446]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/task5.png[/IMG]

Now, when you click 'Start execution' on the task, the time tracking begins. 

[IMG]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/task6.png[/IMG]

Time is counted until you hit the pause button (or finish the task). If you click pause, time tracking stops and you can take a break or stop your working day.

$MESS["INTRANET_USTAT_TELLABOUT_IM_TEXT"] = "Everyone: what tools do you use when you discuss urgent issues with each other? Mail, telephone, sms, Skype, ICQ, Facebook? Having choices is great, but do you know where to find the information 2 weeks later? Here's how it can work in Bitrix24.

[B]Chat[/B]

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=339]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/im1.png[/IMG]

Please note - on our website has its own chat, which already includes all of our employees (and no personal contacts!). Chats with each person or in each group are stored individually and there is a history button where they can be retrieved. Chat can be 1-to-1, group chat, or you can even make voice and video calls from this interface!

[B]Contacts are already there[/B]

Starting in chat is easy because you don't have to add anyone - all employees are already included in your contacts list. Any colleague can be found simply by typing in the field; the Recent tab shows your latest conversations so it's easier to find the people you talk to the most.  

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=339]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/im2.png[/IMG]

Note that if someone is online (that is, available at the moment), the indicator next to their picture will be green. If they are offline or mark themselves as busy, it will be red.

Everything in the chat happens in real time. You can see whether your counterpart is typing a message and you'll get confirmation that messages have been read.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=345]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/im3.png[/IMG]

[B]Group chat[/B]

If you need to talk with several people at once, you can avoid interrupting everyone's workday and just create a group chat. The chat itself will be saved and can be re-opened later so you don't have to create the same group again.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=349]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/im4.png[/IMG]

[B]Message history[/B]

All chats are saved in the intranet, and at any moment you can easily find them, open the 'chat history' in the top right corner, and search for a word or phrase. 

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=345]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/im5.png[/IMG]

[B]Mobile chat[/B]

Chat is accessible via mobile app, along with the other messenger features such as notifications, receiving invitations for meetings, and updates concerning likes, tasks, and comments.

The Bitrix24 mobile app can be easily installed on smartphones and tablets from the [URL=https://itunes.apple.com/app/bitrix24/id561683423]Apple AppStore[/URL] and [URL=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bitrix24.android]Google Play[/URL].

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=461]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/im6.jpg[/IMG]

[B]Video calls[/B]

Sometimes you need more than chat - you need discussion and interaction. The video and audio chat in the very same messenger interface provides exactly that. Not only does it include up to 4 users, but it is free and a great way to unite distant workers.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=305]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/im7.png[/IMG]

You can mute your own microphone if needed.

Video chat is supported in browsers that support WebRTC, such as Chrome. If you work with a different browser, you can use video chat through the desktop app.

[B]Desktop App[/B]

You can stay in touch even without a browser open, by using the Bitrix24 Desktop app. It supports all the functions of the messenger, including video calls, and has additional file sync functions for personal files. It also sits on your toolbar and lets you know when new messages come in.

[/LIST]
Summarizing what we've said so far: we have an instrument that can replace and unit all types of messengers, internal phone calls, and even SMSes - all of which are still being used in one form or another. Using the chat and video calls in Bitrix24, we can communicate exactly as needed - depending on the urgency of the conversation.

[B]Evaluate your activity in the messenger[/B]

You can view the level of your activity in the messenger and compare it to your department and company in the Company Pulse.

$MESS["INTRANET_USTAT_TELLABOUT_DISK_TITLE"] = "Document editing... in 60 seconds";
$MESS["INTRANET_USTAT_TELLABOUT_DISK_TEXT"] = "How are we collaborating on documents now? How do 2 or more of our people co-author a press release or training program? We send each other e-mail, back and forth, with different versions and sometimes with changing groups of recipients. It's easy to get messed up like this - you probably have noticed. 

Using the local shared drive, there's little way to know who made what changes, and more importantly, you can't get to the document if you are not in the office, and someone might have a new copy on their own machine that has not yet been uploaded.

The social intranet greatly simplifies collaboration on documents.

[VIDEO WIDTH=400 HEIGHT=300]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSqOpmqCu6M[/VIDEO]

[B]Sharing a file[/B]

There's nothing complicated about sharing files - you can even create a file in the intranet and share it immediately. To share a file with colleagues for discussion, improvement, or just for their information, you can start just by starting a new post in the Activity Stream. Upload the file, or create a new one (see bottom right in the image below).

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=579]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/disk1.png[/IMG]

All recipients of this message will be able to edit the document if the check box shown above is marked. Furthermore, the document will open up immediately in a preview window when someone clicks on it.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=562]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/disk2.png[/IMG]

[B]Editing a document online[/B]

To edit documents, you don't have to download, save, and then upload. All you need to do from the preview window is choose to edit it using Google Docs or MS Office Online. You can choose either from the pull-down.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=331]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/disk3.png[/IMG]

To preview or edit documents this way, you'll need to be logged in to Microsoft or Google. These are free services.

Now you can edit text and save changes.

After editing the document and saving, the Activity Stream will create a new comment that states that a new version of the document has been created by you.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=428]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/disk4.png[/IMG]

[B]Where to save documents - how to set up a file exchange[/B]

To make sure that your files are always available to your colleagues, we recommend using the Bitrix24.Drive. This is a file sync application that sits inside the Bitrix Desktop App. Your local files will be synchronized with the Bitrix24 intranet document library.

Go to the menu item My Workspace > Files and install the Bitrix24 Desktop App on your local machine.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=194]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/disk5.png[/IMG]

The Desktop app can be downloaded at www.bitrix24.com:
[LIST]
[*]For MacOS [URL]http://dl.bitrix24.com/b24/bitrix24_desktop.dmg[/URL]
[*]For Windows [URL]http://dl.bitrix24.com/b24/bitrix24_desktop.exe[/URL]
[/LIST]
Bitrix24.Drive will create a folder in your file manager that you can use like any other folder. However, the contents of that folder will be synced with a file library in Bitrix24. If you are working offline, then the files will be saved as usual, and as soon as a connection to Bitrix24 is restored, the system will sync automatically.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=397]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/disk6.png[/IMG]

If you save or edit a file in this folder, an identical file in your My Drive library will appear. Likewise, if you open the file from your portal and edit it, the file on your computer will be edited immediately.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=358]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/disk7.png[/IMG]

[B]How to allow or deny access to files[/B]

The [I]My Drive[/I] library is your personal file storage, and you can put access limits on the library on the whole, or on individual files. Access can be granted to any subset of your coworkers, including workgroups or departments.

You can adjust the access on each document as needed, and you can create special download links so that people outside the portal can download the given document. These download links can be time limited or protected by passwords.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=319]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/disk8.png[/IMG]

[B]Evaluate your activity in the Bitrix24.Drive and documents[/B]

To evaluate how active you are in working with documents in relation to your department and the company on the whole, open the Company Pulse and compare your rank with your coworkers.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=271]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/disk9.png[/IMG]

The mobile app gives you access to all the main tools in the Bitrix24 intranet: Activity Stream, comments, likes, calendars with a list of upcoming meetings, tasks, search, and document libraries. Regardless of whether you're in your office or not, you will always be aware of what's going on and be able to get involved in discussions in real time.

In all likelihood, the best part - working in the CRM from the mobile app? The app is fully functional so that when you're on the move, you can get information about customers, make calls to them, check the product catalog, modify transactions and even create invoices. Just imagine how convenient that is - change the lead status or deal right there at the client's office!

$MESS["INTRANET_USTAT_TELLABOUT_CRM_TEXT"] = "Customers and clients, whether potential, existing, or long-standing, are the business. Our job is to learn how to work with each client in the most efficient way possible. Each purchase, each interaction - everything to do with a client should be logged and available.

The CRM in Bitrix24 is ideal for doing just that, and we can use it without leaving the familiar setting of our intranet. And without having to remember the passwords of some other service. 

[VIDEO WIDTH=510 HEIGHT=390]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6K3udpfEOA[/VIDEO]

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=315]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/crm1.png[/IMG]

[B]Client and contact base[/B]

All information about clients (both companies and people), can be logged and easily looked up in the contact base of the CRM. Furthermore, all interactions can be listed and future interactions can be scheduled. Purchases or transactions, called 'Deals' in the CRM, can be kept individually and associated with each client.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=347]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/crm2.png[/IMG]

Each new client that appears should be added to the CRM - don't forget to do this! Potential clients (Leads) can be put in by hand, automatically brought in from our website's contact or feedback form, via email, or imported from a data file.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=278]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/crm3.png[/IMG]

[B]Working with clients[/B]

Remember that the CRM is not just a contact base. It is a tool to help bring and track clients through the purchasing or decision-making process. You can plan calls and meetings, set tasks, or write emails directly from the CRM.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=385]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/crm4.png[/IMG]

[B]Assigning contacts to sales associates[/B]

We can assign leads to different sales associates automatically. All we need to do is set up a Business Process that 'sorts' leads according to whatever conditions we need and then sets the responsible person from our sales team. For example, if the 'opportunity' in the lead is over \$9999, we can send that lead straight to the VIP sales manager.

Deals in the CRM should be created as soon as information about a potential purchase is obtained. The Deal not only tracks the progress of the decision-making process, but provides data for the sales funnel and makes invoice creation a snap.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=309]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/crm5.png[/IMG]

[B]Ongoing interactions with clients[/B]

The data collected in the CRM helps you in future interactions with the clients. You can also plan meetings, follow-up phone calls, and work with clients en masse or individually, since you can sort and filter the client records as needed. Activities is the section that shows you all of your upcoming interactions, and the counter next to it tell you how many require attention asap!

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=171]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/crm6.png[/IMG]

The system lets you send emails (from your email address) and create invoices in very convenient interfaces. Click on the phone number of a contact to initiate an IP telephony call. When you send an invoice to a client, invoice is included as a pdf attachment.

[IMG WIDTH=500 HEIGHT=335]https://www.bitrix24.com/images/ustat/en/crm7.png[/IMG]
